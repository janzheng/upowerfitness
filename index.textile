h3. about

h1(green). Humble Beginnings

p(soft). For most people, losing weight is not easy. It takes dedication and permanent changes most people are unwilling to make. Diets, boot camps, and other solutions intended to "lose weight quickly" are neither sustainable nor realistic. 
<br />
In reality, eating a healthy diet and staying active requires a change in lifestyle that is neither drastic, nor hard to maintain. But it does take hard work and commitment.
<br />
upower fitness was founded on the idea that if you truly desire change in your life, we can make it happen. Because each individual's needs are unique, we work with each person to craft a unique plan - a plan that's right for their goals.

<section class="content" id="about-2">

h1(light). Power to the Community

p(section-intro ). upower fitness is not just about improving your own life, but also about improving lives of others and the life of the community itself. 
<br />
We partner with a number of local non-profit organizations around Atlanta, and once a month, the proceeds of a u-blast class will go towards a select charity.

p(trainer). Babette Lombardo
%(qual)Founder and Head Trainer
ISSA certified personal trainer, CPR/AED certified%

p(trainer-para). Babette Lombardo, the founder and head trainer of upower Fitness has been able to accomplish this by turning her lifelong love of fitness, athletics and helping others into the movement that is upower fitness.
<br />
Babette grew up in a family that always encouraged her to follow her passion and work as hard as she could at everything she did. Her passion for tennis won her an full athletic scholarship at Jacksonville State University, where she earned her Bachelor of Arts degree. Moving to Atlanta in 2008 after graduation, she worked several years in sports marketing. While her love of athletics never waned and her desire to help others in some meaningful way continued to grow stronger, Babette began to realize her true calling. As her charitable work increased with Kate's Club and her fitness and cycle class instruction took off, Babette searched for ways to combine her desire to help with her passion for healthy living. 
<br />
After some time and a lot of discussion with family and friends, the concept of upower Fitness was born. Babette is eager to share her wealth of information about living a healthy, balanced life while simultaneously giving back to the community.

p(trainer-para). I don't train everyone with out finding out that we are a perfect fit. Personal Trainers come a dime a dozen but a relationship with two people is priceless and doesn't come easy.

I ask for a lot in/out of our sessions but I guarantee results. I Love fitness from point A to Z.

SCW (Lifestyle and Behavior Coaching)%

p(trainer-para). Tosha Bailey coaches busy professionals on how to transform their health by getting them:
<br >
- Leaner while still eating their favorite foods, attending social outings and spending less time at the gym. 
- Better by increasing their energy, improving their mobility, building their confidence, while changing their relationship with food and their body. 
- Stronger physically and mentally, so not only can they handle their next workout, but also tackle whatever life throws their way. 
<br >
Tosha has been a full time coach in the fitness industry since 2004. She has earned certifications through NASM (Certified Personal Trainer), TRX (level 1), American Red Cross (CPR/First Aid), New Leaf (Metabolic Specialist), SCW (Lifestyle and Behavior Coaching) and is working towards her Nutrition Coaching Certification through Precision Nutrition. 
<br >
Tosha wasnâ€™t always on the healthy living train. Despite growing up with active parents who were healthy eaters, her love of sweets, not so healthy foods and not being active was a little stronger. It wasnâ€™t until being in anunhappy marriage did she go out for her first run at 23, when her best friend forced her out of the house. From her workouts she gained physical and mental strength and the confidence to end her marriage. Tosha then decided that she wanted to share with others what weight training with a side order of cardio could do for a person. Since she doesnâ€™t believe in the four-letter word, (d-i-e-t) and bland food just isnâ€™t an option, she taught herself how to cook using quality ingredients to create angelic meals that taste sinful! 
<br >
Toshaâ€™s coaching style is straight forward, challenging and fun, meeting you where you currently are in your health journey and getting you where you want to be. 
<br >
If youâ€™re looking to transform your health without giving up everything you enjoy, contact Tosha Bailey at: 404-558-7854 or tosha@toshabaileyfitness.com moms, dads, kids and everyone in between realize that small steps lead changes in lifestyle habits.
